TO FOLLOW BLACK LINE 
If distance from the middle is less than zero
	Put more power into one motor to counter act movement 
If distance from the middle is more than zero 
	Put more power into the other motor to counter act movement 

FOR BLACK LINE BREAK 
Add delay in if statements above then retest the black line
	If no black line is detected.
		Stop and turn around

FOR BLACK LINE FADING 
Make the thresh hold for a white line equal to the line 

EXPANDING LINE 
Works in code  

CURVED CORNER 
Works in code

CURVED LINE 
Works in code 

SHARP 90 DEGREE CORNER & DISTRACTION LINES
If the direction of corners sensors are all black 
	Turn in direction
	If the left sensor detects a continuation of the line 
		Stop turn back and continue 

RUMBLE STRIP 
If the left and right sensors are equal 
	If the time between line 1 and line 2 is shorter than line 2 and line 3 
		Accelerate 
	If the time between line 1 and 2 is larger than line 2 and 3 
		Decelerate 

DIVERGING LINES 
It will follow whatever line it wants 

PARALLEL HALLWAY && CONVERGENT HALLWAY
IF the line ends and at angle =160 distance less than an amount and at angle 20 distance is less than an amount 
	Each motor the same 

DYNAMIC GATE & DEAD END
When it approaches a wall when on the black line then it 
Stops for delay
Retests if wall is still there 
If wall is not there 
	Move forwards 
Else 
	Turn around

GARAGE
IF line ends and there is a wall 
	Stop
